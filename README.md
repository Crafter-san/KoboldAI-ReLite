# KoboldAI-ReLite
Inspired by KoboldAI Lite
The goal is to make a comprehensive and modular framework to allow for easier updates, contribution, and modding. This system allows the user to easily switch which character they or the AI are playing as, in the same interaction. It also allows to tie pre-defined scenarios to interactions, and the ability to change the scenario mid-way through the interaction.
